This is a Flutter package for a Tinder-like card swiper. âœ¨

It allows you to swipe left, right, up, and down and define your own business logic for each direction.

Very smooth animations supporting Android, iOS, Web & Desktop.

## Why?

We built this package because we wanted to:

- Have a fully customizable slider
- Swipe in any direction
- Undo swipes as many times as you want
- Choose your own settings such as duration, angle, padding and more
- Trigger swipes in any direction with the controller
- Add callbacks while swiping, on end, or when the swiper is disabled
- Detect the direction (left, right, top, bottom) the card was swiped

## Show Cases

| Swipe in any direction | Trigger swipes | Unswipe the cards |

## Installation

Add this to your package's `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
card_swiper: ...
```

**OR** run

```yaml
flutter pub add flutter_card_swiper
```

in your project's root directory.

## Usage

You can place your `CardSwiper` inside of a `Scaffold` like we did here. Optional parameters can be defined to enable different features. See the following example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_card_swiper/flutter_card_swiper.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class Example extends StatelessWidget {
  List<Container> cards = [
    Container(
      alignment: Alignment.center,
      child: const Text('1'),
      color: Colors.blue,
    ),
    Container(
      alignment: Alignment.center,
      child: const Text('2'),
      color: Colors.red,
    ),
    Container(
      alignment: Alignment.center,
      child: const Text('3'),
      color: Colors.purple,
    )
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: Flexible(
        child: CardSwiper(
          cardsCount: cards.length,
          cardBuilder: (context, index, percentThresholdX, percentThresholdY) => cards[index],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

#### Controller

The `Controller` is used to swipe the card from outside of the widget. You can create a controller called `CardSwiperController` and save the instance for further usage. Please have a closer look at our [Example](https://github.com/ricardodalarme/flutter_card_swiper/tree/main/example) for the usage.

| Method      | Description                                    |
| ----------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| swipe       | Swipes the card to a specific direction.       |
| undo        | Bring back the last card that was swiped away. |
| moveTo      | Change the top card to a specific index.       |
